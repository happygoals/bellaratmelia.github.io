								<h2>(MadVR) Menu interfaces to avoid disembodiment situations in virtual reality
</h2>
<br><br><br>
								<h3> Aims and Objectives</h3>
<p>This study aims to find a better way to close the gap between VR and reality. 
Some people often experience disembodiment after playing games in a virtual reality environment.
 When the space that a personâ€™s eyes see and the space that his/her body feels are different, humans experience separation. </br>
This causes such users to feel very often nervous and tense. This feeling of anxiety may take a while because the virtual environment feels so real to them. 
</br>
One of the problems with virtual reality today is that the technology makes reality immersive. </br></br> The Virtual Reality environment often overwhelms new users with its menu interface. There is sometimes a long menu with many applications that scrolls in the window in front of the user, and the menu interface of most VR programs is marked out with little organization or structure to categorize VR app content.
</br>
While more and more content is pouring into VR, the question of what the best user-centered menus are in VR is far from resolved. 
To better utilize the benefits of virtual reality, the virtual reality user experience and its interface need a lot of advancement at this point. </br> 

</br>In this study, we would like to: 
</br> -Contribute to improving menu interface design in virtual reality. </br>
-Investigate the way to help to resolve the disembodiment issue in virtual reality.</br>
-Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each different menu style in a Virtual reality environment. </br>
-Test 5 different styles of menus in virtual reality with a young age group and compare the result with the expectation of the menu efficiency before we test and prove. 
</br></br>
<h3> Methodology</h3>
<p>
Types of virtual reality menus to find most effective variations:
</br>Square/Flat menu
</br>Floating menu
</br>Scrolling menu
</br>In-depth menu
</br>3D menu
